Focus on higher population areas

Maybe NY/LA which are higher populations

Aggregating the data

Sufficient number of observations for ML: 10,000 data points per group

Decision Tree: What factors causing lung cancer

A heat map for death rate changes over years selected (visualization)

Model could predict death or rate of cancer for that particular year or geographic region



Other topics we will try to answer:


- Description of the data exploration phase of the project
- Description of the analysis phase of the project
- Technologies, languages, tools, and algorithms used throughout the project
- Result of analysis
- Recommendation for future analysis
- Anything the team would have done differently


Other things for consideration:
data_Location: New York

Categories: income, health coverage, air pollution, neighborhoods, smoking, alcohol, population density
Sufficient number of observations for ML: 1,000+  data points per group

Decision Tree: What factors causing lung cancer

A heat map for death rate changes over years selected (visualization)

Model could predict death or rate of cancer for that particular year or geographic region
