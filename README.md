# Final_Project
## Selected topic:Cancer (Lung Cancer)

## Reason for selected topic: 
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the world. In tuhe United States, it is the second leading case of death just behind heart disease; where 1 in every 4 deaths is due to Cancer (CDC). Lung Cancer is the third most common Cancer in the United States (CDC).


## Questions to Answer with the Data

Finding correlation of lung cancer with income, health coverage, air pollution, neighborhoods, smoking, alcohol, population density, other factors (These factors are subject to change with datasets we find).

## Machine learning model:
* Train a machine learning model with existing datasets and predict the possibility of developing lung cancer.
* Model could predict death or rate of cancer for that particular year or geographic region
* The preliminary data includes columns that describe different factors that can influence lung cancer.  

* These features include the income, health coverage, air pollution, neighborhoods, smoking, alcohol, population density  etc.
* From all the features,we will choose the features that we believed would have the highest correlation with lung cancer..
* The data will be split into training and test data using the train_test_split function. We will use the default 75% to 25% split.
