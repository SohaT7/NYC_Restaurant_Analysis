# Final_Project

## Machine learning model:
* Train a machine learning model with existing datasets and predict the possibility of developing lung cancer.
* Model could predict death or rate of cancer for that particular year or geographic region
* The preliminary data includes columns that describe different factors that can influence lung cancer.  

* These features include the income, health coverage, air pollution, neighborhoods, smoking, alcohol, population density  etc.
* From all the features,we will choose the features that we believed would have the highest correlation with lung cancer..
* The data will be split into training and test data using the train_test_split function. We will use the default 75% to 25% split.
